# Some Training Tips Of Deep Learning Model For The Beginners
This project summarizes some Deep Learning model training tips that rely on the practice of image classification that implements with the CNN model by Keras. The datasets are based on [kaggle dog breed identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification) . The model only uses the top 5 classes of samples, so it could run in google Colaboratory.
