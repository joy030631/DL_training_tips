# Some Training Tips Of Deep Learning Model For The Beginners

This project summarizes some tips for training a deep learning model for image classification, in which the model is hand-crafted from scratch based on the Keras library. We evaluate the experiments on the Kaggle dataset [''dog breed identification''](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification). Due to the computational limitations of the google colaboratory, we use only 5 classes with the top 5 samples for the classification.
